# QR Code Scan and Create App

Hello, I am Muhammed AKAR i have been dealing with **flutter** for a year this is one of my projects. This app is a fast and user-friendly QR code scanner and generator application. This app can read and create QR codes containing text, links, contact information, geographical locations, and more. I am waiting for your comments. ðŸ«¡

### QR Code Scanner:
You can scan QR codes using your device's camera. No internet connection is required.

### QR Code Generator:
Create your own QR codes. They can contain various data types such as text, URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, or geographical locations.
